GoringetalPollenRichness
========================

R Markdown code for Goring et al. in press. Pollen assemblage richness does not reflect regional plant species richness: a cautionary tale for palaeoecologists. Journal of Ecology.

This is the R Markdown version of the paper Goring et al. Pollen assemblage richness does not reflect regional plant species richness: a cautionary tale for palaeoecologists.

This document comes with the compiled HTML file (of the same name), but this file includes all the original R code and can be compiled using RStudio, with the knitr package.  Please note that although the results here will be numerically similar to those presented in the original paper, they will not be exactly the same.  This is for several reasons:
  1.  Rounding and random number generation might induce small changes.  It is possible to include a random.seed in this code, but:
  
  2.  The primary BC Plants dataset loaded in this file is only a part of the larger dataset.  Due to data-use agreements we have used a random subset of the larger dataset (30%), and we have jittered the plot locations by up to 0.2 degrees latitude (we have kept elevations unchanged).

** Note for those interested **
If you have interest in this paper or the code please contact me.  I'd be happy to hear of potential improvements, suggestions or ideas.
